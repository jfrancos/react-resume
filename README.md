# React resume

I had to make a resume, but I was daunted by the idea of keeping styles and formatting consistent in a word processor. So I created it as a React app.

The color ([with some Lch tweaking](http://davidjohnstone.net/pages/lch-lab-colour-gradient-picker)) and the large Bodoni font in the header, are meant to emulate [Henle's](https://www.henle.de/) Urtext edition covers.
